# Game of life
The Game of Life, also known as Conway's Game of Life or simply Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

## Why Game of Life?
The primary fascinating aspect of the "game" is that with very simple rules it's possible to create systems of breathataking complexity. The game has only four basic rules, and yet you can create oscillators, glider guns, and even ultimately a general purpose computer. You can even build a machine in Life that runs Life with graphics!

As shown in this codebase, developing the Game of Life efficiently generates a series of challenges in algorithm design, parallel computing and data structures, making it a great study in performance engineering and computational science.

TODO:
- Is printing a .png for each iteration better than printing in the terminal? Is it possible to convert to gif automatically? 
- Is splitting the display and the calculation part into 2 different processes a good idea?
